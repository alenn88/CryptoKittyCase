It will also display whether your cats are "fancy" or "exclusive," if appropriate. Due to API constraints, you can display up to 12 kitties at a time.

Pass in your address via $("cryptokitties").cryptoCase(MY_ADDRESS);
You can find your address at the top of your profile page on the CryptoKitty site.
